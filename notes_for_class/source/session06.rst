Issues that came up during the week.
====================================

Getting an arbitrary key from a dict
------------------------------------

See ``arbitrary_key.py`` in `examples/session04`


dict as switch -- how do you leave the loop?
--------------------------------------------

Let's look at Eowyn's solution...


globals??
---------

a number of you have been putting code in the global (module) namespace:

.. code-block:: python

   the_dict = {}

   def fun():
       ...
       the_dict = something()

What's wrong with this?

More on keyword arguments:
