# Procedure
# Be sure to follow all the steps described in the Procedure section of the List
# LabExercise but this time, create a new file called strformat_lab.py in your student
# dir in the class repo.

# When the empty script is available and runnable, complete the following six tasks.

################################## Task One ##################################

# Write a format string that will take the following four element tuple:

# 1

# The first element is used to generate a filename that can help with file sorting. The
# idea behind the “file_002” is that if you have a bunch of files that you want to name
# with numbers that can be sorted, you need to “pad” the numbers with zeros to get the
# right sort order.

# In [1]: fnames = ['file001', 'file002', 'file010', 'file011']
# In [3]: sorted(fnames)
# Out[3]: ['file001', 'file002', 'file010', 'file011']

# 2

# The second element is a floating point number. You should display it with 2 decimal
# places shown.

# 3

# The third value is an integer, but could be any number. You should display it in
# scientific notation, with 2 decimal places shown.

# 4

# The fourth value is a float with a lot of digits – display it in scientific notation 
# with 3 significant figures.








################################## Task Two ##################################

# Using your results from Task One, repeat the exercise, but this time using an
# alternate type of format string (hint: think about alternative ways to use .format()
# (keywords anyone?), and also consider f-strings if you’ve not used them already).








################################## Task Three ##################################

# Rewrite:
"the 3 numbers are: {:d}, {:d}, {:d}".format(1,2,3)

# def formatter(in_tuple):
#    do_something_here_to_make_a_format_string
#
#    return form_string.format(in_tuple)









################################## Task Four ##################################

# Given a 5 element tuple:

# ( 4, 30, 2017, 2, 27)

# use string formating to print:

# '02 27 2017 04 30'

# Hint: use index numbers to specify positions.











################################## Task Five ##################################

# f-strings are new to Python (version 3.6), but are very powerful and efficient. This
# means they are worth understanding and using. And this is made easier than it might
# be because they use the same, familiar formatting language that is conventionally
# used in Python (in .format()).

# Here’s a task for you: Given the following four element list:

# ['oranges', 1.3, 'lemons', 1.1]

# Write an f-string that will display:

# The weight of an orange is 1.3 and the weight of a lemon is 1.1

# Now see if you can change the f-string so that it displays the names of the fruit in
# upper case, and the weight 20% higher (that is 1.2 times higher).









################################## Task Six ##################################

# Write some Python code to print a table of several rows, each with a name, an age and
#a cost. Make sure some of the costs are in the hundreds and thousands to test your
#alignment specifiers.

# And for an extra task, given a tuple with 10 consecutive numbers, can you work how to
# quickly print the tuple in columns that are 5 charaters wide? It’s easily done on one
# short line!
