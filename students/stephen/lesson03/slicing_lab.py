# Write some functions that take a sequence as an argument,
# and return a copy of that sequence:
# with the first and last items exchanged.
# with every other item removed.
# with the first and last 4 items removed, and every other item in between.
# with the elements reversed (just with slicing).
# with the middle third, then last third, then the first third in the new order.
