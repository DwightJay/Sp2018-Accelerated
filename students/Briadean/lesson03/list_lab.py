# Series 1
# Create a list that contains “Apples”, “Pears”, “Oranges” and “Peaches”.
# Display the list (plain old print() is fine…).
# Ask the user for another fruit and add it to the end of the list.
# Display the list.
# Ask the user for a number and display the number back to the user and the fruit corresponding to that number (on a 1-is-first basis). Remember that Python uses zero-based indexing, so you will need to correct.
# Add another fruit to the beginning of the list using “+” and display the list.
# Add another fruit to the beginning of the list using insert() and display the list.
# Display all the fruits that begin with “P”, using a for loop.

fruit = ["Apples", "Pears", "Oranges", "Peaches"]

print("So far, you have {}".format(fruit))
fruit.append(input("Which fruit would you like to add? ").capitalize())
print("Now you have {}".format(fruit))




# Series 2
# Using the list created in series 1 above:

# Display the list.
# Remove the last fruit from the list.
# Display the list.
# Ask the user for a fruit to delete, find it and delete it.
# (Bonus: Multiply the list times two. Keep asking until a match is found. Once found, delete all occurrences.)

# Series 3
# Again, using the list from series 1:

# Ask the user for input displaying a line like “Do you like apples?” for each fruit in the list (making the fruit all lowercase).
# For each “no”, delete that fruit from the list.
# For any answer that is not “yes” or “no”, prompt the user to answer with one of those two values (a while loop is good here)
# Display the list.
# Series 4
# Once more, using the list from series 1:

# Make a copy of the list and reverse the letters in each fruit in the copy.
# Delete the last item of the original list. Display the original list and the copy.
