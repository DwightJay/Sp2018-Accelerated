# Bionic Beaver 18.04 Beta Upgrade on Ubuntu build notes

[Ubuntu](https://community.ubuntu.com/t/contribute/26) is a popular Linux distribution available as Free and Open Source Software on the internet for download. It is widely supported by a robust software development community dedicated to long term support of powerful coding tools available for free to the general public. About every two years a new "LTS" is released and this current iteration is known as ["Bionic Beaver"](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-server/daily/current/HEADER.html) and given the numeric version of 18.04

Bionic Beaver is scheduled for official release at the end of April 2018. At the time of this writing the Beta version is available for download and to install and update only required a few minor configuration changes to allow the code to automatically compile and execute.

The detailed steps I used were obtained by a simple google search resulting in a published article with step by step process and accompanying screenshots confirming each important input. This is common with Ubuntu, Linux and the F.O.S.S. movement in general. [HOW TO UPGRADE FROM UBUNTU 17.10 (ARTFUL AARDVARK) TO UBUNTU 18.04 LTS](https://websiteforstudents.com/how-to-upgrade-from-ubuntu-17-10-artful-aardvark-to-ubuntu-18-04-lts-beta/)

My laptop was running Ubuntu Artful Aardvark 17.10 prior to upgrade. This was a prerequisite of the process I followed and some of the configuration recommended had already been in place on my existing build. Very little reconfiguration was required in the end and the result was what I hoped for in that it updated to Python 3.6.5 which was my intended goal.

Further, with this configuration, when Bionic Beaver LTS rolls out in a few weeks I'm configured now to receive and implement those changes automatically with likely only a few authorization clicks away from having their new long term support on a stable platform without much debate. Certainly there will be more updates, but that is nothing new to any operating system and managing that process will continue either way.

This document is dedicated to the process and I will attempt to continue to post here additional information on this topic.

I came across another helpful article that should be linked. [How To Upgrade Ubuntu To 18.04 LTS Bionic Beaver](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-upgrade-to-ubuntu-18-04-lts-bionic-beaver) included alternative instructions for the Debian way for those with the slightly different flavor of Linux.
